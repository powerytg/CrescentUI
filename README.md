CrescentUI
==========

High performance, beautifully designed mobile UI framework for Flex/AIR on Android


History

Crescent UI is part of the Cavalier Project. This is the UI framework for the series.


Goal

The Crescent UI's solo goal is to showcase the idea the even extremely complex UI can run smoothly on a low end mobile device (Android phone with 1G single core CPU), with careful optimization. 

Crescent UI is designed to be multi-screen, which means it runs on both mobile AIR and desktop AIR/FlashPlayer environment. For more info, see the Cavalier Project repo:
